#### The genotype-phenotype relationship through the pangenome perspective
My thesis work aims to explore the phenotypic impact of structural variants (SVs) in a large natural population of the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. I used a pangenomic approach based on long read sequences for more than a thousand isolates combined with association studies. 

Thesis supervisors: Joseph Schacherer, Anne Friedrich
